# Hi, welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissor-Boulder!

### It's like rock-paper-scissors but it's more advanced, funner, and frankly a better game all around. It gives players the options a to not only broaden their options and probability, but also throws a trump card in the mix as the newest variable of the game overrides all of other variables.  However, because of our new addition, this platform will generate a random variable within the parameters of the game. This turns the game fully into a game of chance and luck. This version is exclusive to this platform only since the game will generate variables. Otherwise, this would be completely unfair and unplayedable in person unless personal stipulations were implemented by players; kind of like Uno.

## The rules and instructions are as follows:

1. Player will play against Computer
1.1 Optional: Player will sound off a cadence 4 syllables of R-P-S-B
2. Player will press play and generate a variable
3. RPSB will follows traditional rules of RPS but as aforementioned, Boulder will trump all.
